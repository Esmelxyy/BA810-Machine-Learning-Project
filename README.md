## Project Title
### Machine Learning Application in Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
The dataset has been used in this project was picked from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction?datasetId=2008274&sortBy=voteCount

In this project, my teammates and I aimed to identify some key drivers of customer churn to help banks monitor trigger events that indicate whether a customer will leave while encouraging banks to improve their customer experience services to lower churn rates.

We built several machine learning classification models, such as decision tree, SVM, random forest and XGboost etc., and conduted several hyperparameter tuning processes to get some evaluation metrics which could help us find the most important predictor variables. Based on these top effected variables, we generated some strategies and recommendations to help the bank increase its retention rate at the end of our project.
